Extensions to SRL's TRSWalker.


------------

type RSHeightMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RSHeightMap is the type responsible for handling heights with walker when using WaspLib.
This type does not need to be initiated as a variable and it's meant to be used directly with it's static methods.

It has the following variables:
  Enabled: Boolean;
  Map: TMufasaBitmap;
  MaxHeight: Double;
  MathCache: Double;

**Enabled** is used to toggle the RSHeightMap on/off. By default it will always be on unless there's not a heightmap available for the map you load into walker.
the heightmap MUST be named the same as the map you load with an "h" prepended. E.G.: hWorld.png

**Map** there's not much to talk about this one, it's simply the TMufasaBitmap loaded in the record.

**MaxHeight** This is what will be considered the max height possible in the calculations made by RSHeightMap.
There's no way to accurately know what this should be, you should debug heights and set a value that looks good to you.
Values might also vary between regions but I find **30** to be a fine value that works well in a lot of places if not all.

**MathCache**, not very important, simply a cache variable so we don't repeat calculations when it's not required.


------------

RSHeightMap.GetColor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function RSHeightMap.GetColor(p: TPoint): Int64; static;

Returns the color of the heightmap at the specified point.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn RSHeightMap.GetColor([100, 100]);


------------

TRSWalkerMap.InternalCacheMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerMap.InternalCacheMap(FileName: String): String; static; override;

Overrides SRL's TRSWalkerMap.InternalCacheMap() so maps cached files can be versioned with WL_WALKER_MAP_VERSION.
Otherwise if you update your map the cache won't change and users will keep using the old image until they delete it.
This is an internal TRSWalkerMap method and you should probably not use it directly.


------------

TRSWalkerMap.InternalLoadMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerMap.InternalLoadMap(FileName: String; Region: TBox = []): TMufasaBitmap; static; override;

Overrides SRL's TRSWalkerMap.InternalLoadMap() so maps cached files can be versioned with WL_WALKER_MAP_VERSION.
Otherwise if you update your map the cache won't change and users will keep using the old image until they delete it.
This is an internal TRSWalkerMap method and you should probably not use it directly.


------------

TRSWalkerMap.FindMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerMap.FindMap(Map: String): String; static; override;

Overrides SRL's TRSWalkerMap.FindMap() so it uses WaspLib's walker directory instead.
This is an internal Walker method, you probably don't need to call it.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn TRSWalkerMap.FindMap('world');


------------

TRSWalkerMap.Load
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  procedure TRSWalkerMap.Load(FileName: String; Scaling: Integer); override;
  procedure TRSWalkerMap.Load(FileName: String; ARegions: TBoxArray; Scaling: Integer; Padding: Integer = 50); override;

Overrides SRL's TRSWalkerMap.Load() so it loads the respective heightmap if it exists.
This is an internal Walker method, you probably don't need to call it.


------------

Walker.InternalSetup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.InternalSetup(); override;

Overrides SRL's Walker.InternalSetup() so it uses WaspWeb as the walker webgraph and so it uses ScreenWalk by default.
This is an internal Walker method, you probably don't need to call it.
It also sets up the ScriptWalker pointer which is used for several things in WaspLib like TRSWalkerObjects and Skunk's transport system.


------------

Walker.SetupNamedRegion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.SetupNamedRegion(region: TRSBankRegion = []); overload;

Use this if you want to setup a walker with whatever the user has setup in WLSettings.BankLocation.
You can optionally pass in your own **region** but it's really meant to use the default.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WLSettings.BankLocation := EWLBankLocation.CASTLE_WARS_BANK;
  Walker.SetupNamedRegion();
  Walker.Map.Map.Debug();


------------

Walker.SetupFromURL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.SetupFromURL(url: String; map: String = ''; scaling: Int32 = 8; forceDownload: Boolean = False); overload;

Allows you to setup a TRSWalker with a map from the internet.
You can optionally skip downloading the file if it already exists by using **forceDownload**.
If **map** is empty, the url file name will be used.


------------

Walker.AddRegion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.AddRegion(region: TBox); overload;

Add a region to walker on the fly after it is already setup.


------------

Walker.GetHeight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.GetHeight(p: TPoint = []; global: Boolean = True): Double;

Returns the height of the player at the specified coordinate with the help of RSHeightMap.
If p is [], which is the default then we will use our current position.
global decides wether the coordinate is converted to global coordinates or internal walker coordinates (read about walker regions for more info).

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn rsw.GetHeight();


------------

Walker.DebugHeightTiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.DebugHeightTiles(angle: Double = -1);

Displays a debug image of the tiles visible on the mainscreen with their height adjusted according to the RSHeightMap.
This is very useful if you need to adjust RSHeightMap.MaxHeight.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  rsw.DebugHeightTiles();


------------

Walker.GetMyPos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.GetMyPos(out height: Double): TPoint; overload;

Overload that also returns the player height.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn RSW.GetMyPos(height);
  WriteLn height;


------------

Walker.GetHeightDiff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.GetHeightDiff(p: TPoint): Double;
  function TRSWalker.GetHeightDiff(p, q: TPoint): Double; overload;

Returns the height difference between 2 points. If only one point is passed, the player position is used as one of them.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn RSW.GetMyPos(RSW.GetMyPos(), [100, 100]);


------------

RSHeightMap.DebugPosition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure RSHeightMap.DebugPosition(p: TPoint);

Debug a point in the loaded heightmap.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  RSHeightMap.DebugPosition(RSW.GetMyPos());


------------

TRSWalker.IsWalkable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.IsWalkable(worldPoint: TPoint; playerPoint: TPoint; Angle: Double): Boolean; override;

Overriden to change the default behavior of TRSWalker.IsWalkable(), specifically for ScreenWalking since I don't like the default behaviour.
I find that minimap limits is extremely close to the render distance in the mainscreen, so personally I rather not
have the function bother any further if **worldPoint** is not on the minimap.

This override will affect both TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.AtTile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.AtTile(worldPoint: TPoint; Distance: Int32 = 4): Boolean;
  function TRSWalker.AtTile(worldPointArray: TPointArray; Distance: Int32 = 4): Boolean; overload;

method used to quickly check if we are within distance of a certain **worldPoint**. This distance is measure in pixels and in a radial way.
You can optionally pass in a TPA to check if the closest point is within distance.

This is a TRSWalker method so it will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.GetClosestPoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.GetClosestPoint(worldPointArray: TPointArray): TPoint;

method used to get the closest Point to the Player out of a TPA.

This is a TRSWalker method so it will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.WebWalk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.WebWalk(destinations: TPointArray; waitUntilDistance: Int32 = 0; pathRandomness: Double = 0): Boolean; overload;

method used to webwalk to the closest Point to the player.
An example use case is for example, if you have sevel bank booths you can use, those would be your **Destination** TPA.
You will likely want to use the closest bank booth to you, so you use this.

This is a TRSWalker method so it will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.WorldToMM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.WorldToMM(me: TPoint; tpa: TPointArray; radians: Double): TPointArray; overload;
  function TRSWalker.WorldToMM(tpa: TPointArray): TPointArray; overload;
  function TRSWalker.WorldToMM(me: TPoint; atpa: T2DPointArray; radians: Double): T2DPointArray; overload;
  function TRSWalker.WorldToMM(atpa: T2DPointArray): TPointArray; overload;
  function TRSWalker.WorldToMM(me: TPoint; dotFilter: TRSDotFilter; roll: Double = $FFFF): TRSDotFilter; overload;
  function TRSWalker.WorldToMM(dotFilterArray: TRSDotFilterArray; roll: Double = $FFFF): TRSDotFilterArray; overload;

Overloaded methods required for ATPAs and TRSDotFilters. For more information on TRSDotFilter check their documentation.

This is a TRSWalker method so it will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.MakePointVisible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.MakePointVisible(p: TPoint): Boolean;
  function TRSWalker.MakePointVisible(tpa: TPointArray): Boolean; overload;

Wrapper function used to attempt to make a Point visible on the MainScreen.

This are TRSWalker methods so they will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.GetCuboidMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.GetCuboidMS(me, loc: TPoint; tile: Vector3 = [1, 1, 4]; Offset: Vector2 = [0, 0]): TPointArray;
  function TRSWalker.GetCuboidMS(loc: TPoint; tile: Vector3 = [1, 1, 4]; Offset: Vector2 = [0, 0]): TPointArray; overload;

This are TRSWalker methods so they will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.

To understand what this does, you should read about **TRSMinimap.GetTileMS()** and **TPointArray.ConvexHull()** and understand what they do.
This calls **TRSMinimap.GetCuboidMS()** internally which in turn will use both methods above.

To put it simply, this will will first calculate a floor rectangle with **tile.Z**, or **height** if you prefer
of 0 and then calculate the top rectangle of the **tile.Z** you specified.

After this 2 rectangles are calculated a polygon is then made out of the two, resulting in a ConvexHull which is returned.

This is perfect to to get an accurate bounding polygon of objects and NPCs which you can use to accurately color search after.

The example below will show you how it could be used to retrieve an accurate player bounding polygon:

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  
  Debug(RSW.GetCuboidMS([100, 100], [1, 1, 4], Offset));     //This will draw a polygon around the coordinate [100, 100].


------------

TRSWalker.GetTileArrayMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.GetTileArrayMS(me: TPoint; locArray: TPointArray; tile: Vector3 = [1, 1, 0]; Offset: Vector2 = [0, 0]): TRectArray;
  function TRSWalker.GetTileArrayMS(locArray: TPointArray; tile: Vector3 = [1, 1, 0]; Offset: Vector2 = [0, 0]): TRectArray; overload;

This are wrapper functions to retrieve multiple tiles. Refer to SRL's TRSWalker.GetTileMSEx() and TRSWalker.GetTileMS() for more information.

This are TRSWalker methods so they will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.


------------

TRSWalker.GetCuboidArrayMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalker.GetCuboidArrayMS(me: TPoint; locArray: TPointArray; tile: Vector3 = [1, 1, 4]; Offset: Vector2 = [0, 0]): T2DPointArray;
  function TRSWalker.GetCuboidArrayMS(locArray: TPointArray; tile: Vector3 = [1, 1, 4]; Offset: Vector2 = [0, 0]): T2DPointArray;

Gives you an array of mainscreen polygons. Read **Minimap.GetCuboidMS** for more information.

This are TRSWalker methods so they will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  TPA := Minimap.GetDots(ERSMinimapDot.Player);   //find all player dots and returns their coodinates.
  Debug(Minimap.GetCuboidArrayMS(TPA, [2, 3, 5], [2, 2])); //This will draw a polygon that is 2 by 3 tiles and height 5 in the mainscreen where each NPC is.


------------

TRSWalker.GetMMPoly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.GetMMPoly(tpa: TPointArray): TPointArray; deprecated 'Use TRSWalker.WorldToMM() instead.';

This function converts a list of points to their respective points in the minimap.
This is extremely useful if you want to be sure you are within an area.
To make a polygon or a polygon array easily you can use Simba/Includes/WaspLib/tools/walkerpolygon.simba.

This are TRSWalker methods so they will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  
  Debug(RSW.GetMMPoly(TPA).Connect());    //This will draw your TPA on the minimap.


------------

TRSWalker.InPoly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.InPoly(locArray: TPointArray): Boolean;

Checks if you are inside a polygon. If you need to debug the polygon check the example in TRSWalker.GetMMPoly.

This are TRSWalker methods so they will exist both on TRSWalker and TRSWalker.
