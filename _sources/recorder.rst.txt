Recorder
========
Heavily based in Olly's SimbaRecorder: https://github.com/ollydev/SimbaRecorder

This was modified to:
- Allow recording while using remoteinput
- Add frame filters to hide Username/XPBar.

Things to keep in mind when using recorder:
- It spawns another simba thread, which means it will count towards the WaspLib maximum thread limit.

This can be used to record the last few seconds of a script shutting down/crashing.


------------

.. code-block:: pascal


  type Recorder = record(TSRLBaseRecord) class var
    PID: Integer;
    Debugging: Boolean;
  end;


------------

.. code-block:: pascal


  procedure Recorder.Start(window: PtrUInt; seconds: Int32; directory: String; userBox, expBox: TBox); static; overload;
  procedure Recorder.Start(seconds: Integer; directory: String; userBox, expBox: TBox = []); static; overload;

Start the recorder.
- **window** should be the window you want to record, hidding this parameter will use **SimbaTargetWindow()** for it.
- **seconds** is the amount of "last" seconds you want the recorder to record.
- **directory** is the directory you want the file to be saved to.
- **userBox** and **expBox** are "box filters" to hide username and XPBar.
