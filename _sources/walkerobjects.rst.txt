TRSWalkerObject
===============
Methods to handle TRSWalkerObjects.
TRSWalkerObject can be anything that you want to interact with on the mainscreen.
They are divided in 2 main categories and one of them in 3 sub-categories but the usage is only limited by your imagination:
  - RSObjects (TRSWalkerObjects that don't have a dot on the minimap)
  - MMDots:   (TRSWalkerObjects that have a dot on the minimap)
    -RSNPCs
    -RSGroundItems
    -RSPlayers

How do they work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TRSWalkerObjects are very customizable and can be used to interact with almost everything.
For some niche use cases it might be worth do something custom or override some methods to get the behavior you want.

The default way they work is:
- WaspLib checks if you are in the TRSWalkerObject.Coordinates range.
  If not and you used one of the **Walk** methods, it will walk to that location.
- Being in the TRSWalkerObject location, then we check if our TRSWalkerObject is a TRSObject or a TRSMMDot.
  for a TRSObject we stick with the TRSWalkerObject.Coordinates, for TRSMMDots, the coordinates are changed to the minimap dots that within the radius specified when the TRSWalkerObject was setup.
- WaspLib then convert the coordinate along with the TRSWalkerObject.ShapeArray information to a TCuboidArray on the mainscreen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid).
- This TCuboidArray is the "bounds" of our targets. Each one should accurately surround each of our possible targets.
- Then WaspLib runs MainScreen.FindObject() inside of each TCuboid. For more info on how this works read the TRSObjectFinder documentation (https://torwent.github.io/SRL-T/mainscreen.html#type-trsobjectfinder).
- An ATPA of the found colors inside each cuboid is then returned.
- If the method used is related to hovering or clicking, we hover the closest target and then check if TRSWalkerObject.UpText matches the uptext.
- If it does and we are using a clicking method, we click it.
- If we use a **select** method, if the option is not in the uptext we right click the target and select that option.


This is the default behavior but TRSWalkerObjects are very customizable and functionality can be toggled on with TRSWalkerObject.Filter:
- Filter.Walker: Disables walker for the TRSWalkerObject. Coordinates are ignored and still use the minimap dots that are visible on the
  minimap if we are talking about a TRSMMDot, otherwise only MainScreen.FindObject() is used.
- Filter.MinimapDot: Disables the usage of minimap dots for TRSMMDots. TRSObjects have this off by default. Disabling this for TRSMMDots is only useful if the the Player, NPC or Item is in a fixed position.
- Filter.Finder: Disables color checking. The returned cuboids by Walker and MM2MS are our targets. This is useful for things that are "invisible" like agility shortcuts and/or things that have colors that are just unreliable.
- UpText: Ignore all uptext when hovering the targets
- Filter.Skip: This is an internal filter that you probably don't want to use directaly. Decides which TRSWalkerObjects setup is skipped during wasplib's setup process.

.. note:: You cannot disable Filter.Walker, Filter.MinimapDot, Filter.Finder all at the same time. You need one of them enabled and keep in mind that TRSObjects already have Filter.MinimapDot disabled.


------------

Walker.InternalSetup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.InternalSetup(); override;

This is an internal TRSWalker function and you shouldn't touch it unless you know what you are doing.
This is overriden so it sets up the TRSWalkerObject.Walker pointer and TRSWalkerObject.Regions which are used to know when to enable TRSWalkerObject.Filter.Skip.
TRSWalkerObjects coordinates that are outside our TRSWalkerObject.Regions boxes are skipped on WaspLib's setup process.


------------

Walker.Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.Setup(Regions: TBoxArray; Scaling: Integer = 8); override;

You shouldn't modify this unless you know what you are doing, otherwise you might break TRSWalkerObjects.
This is overriden so it sets up TRSWalkerObject.Regions which are used to know when to enable TRSWalkerObject.Filter.Skip.
TRSWalkerObjects coordinates that are outside our TRSWalkerObject.Regions boxes are skipped on WaspLib's setup process.


------------

Walker.Click
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.Click(MinimapPoint: TPoint; Randomness: Int32): Boolean; override;

You shouldn't modify this unless you know what you are doing, otherwise you might break TRSWalkerObjects.
This is overriden so if we redclick our current TRSWalkerObject target while mainscreen walking we disable walker.
When we start the walking process towards a TRSWalkerObject, TRSWalkerObject.CurrentUpText is temporarily set so we
know what we are looking for while walking. Once we click the target TRSWalkerObject.CurrentUpText is cleared.


------------

TRSWalkerObject.Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  procedure TRSWalkerObject.Setup();
  procedure TRSWalkerObject.Setup(coordinates: TPointArray); overload;
  procedure TRSWalkerObject.Setup(upText: TStringArray); overload;

TRSWalkerObject setup methods. You usually need to call 2 of this:

- The version with coordinates

- The version with uptext


The version without parameters is automatically called by the one that takes in the uptext.

They should also be called in that order because `TRSWalkerObject.Setup(coordinates: TPointArray)` is where
we decide if TRSWalkerObject.Filter.Skip is going to be true or not.

Keep in mind if you don't use a TRSWalker in your script and want to use TRSWalkerObjects, you will need to manually setup them in your script
because they will all be skipped.
So you need to set `TRSWalkerObject.Filter.Skip := False` and then call `TRSWalkerObject.Setup(upText: TStringArray)`

Normal usage in the following example.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  //Example with walker:
  var
    rsw: TRSWalker;
    obj: TRSObject; //This is a type of TRSWalkerObject.
  begin
    rsw.Setup();
    obj.Setup([[200, 200]]);
    obj.Setup(['My', 'uptext']);
  end;


  //Example without walker:
  var
    obj: TRSObject; //This is a type of TRSWalkerObject.
  begin
    obj.Setup(['My', 'uptext']);
  end;


------------

TRSWalkerObject.GetCuboidArray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSWalkerObject.GetCuboidArrayEx(out floorTiles, roofTiles: TRectArray): TCuboidArray;
  function TRSWalkerObject.GetCuboidArray(): TCuboidArray;

Internal TRSWalkerObject method responsible for returning a TCuboidArray of our target on the 3D world (on mainscreen and outside of it).
You will probably never need to use this directly.
You can visually see this in action by using the `Debug()` methods, this is responsible for the white lines surounding the targets.


------------

TRSWalkerObject.FindOnMainScreen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerObject.FindOnMainScreen(cuboidArray: TCuboidArray): T2DPointArray;

Internal TRSWalkerObject method responsible for filtering a TCuboidArray by what's visible in the mainscren.
This is meant to filter TRSWalkerObject.GetCuboidArray() so targets that are outside of the mainscreen are filtered out.
You will probably never need to use this directly.


------------

TRSWalkerObject.OnMainScreen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerObject.OnMainScreen(cuboidArray: TCuboidArray): Boolean;

Internal TRSWalkerObject method that returns true or false if we have TCuboids visible on the mainscreen.
You probably don't need to use this directly.


------------

TRSWalkerObject._UpTextCheck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerObject._UpTextCheck(out shouldExit: Boolean): Boolean;

Internal TRSWalkerObject helper method that is used by all hovering methods.
You probably don't need to use this directly.


------------

TRSWalkerObject._WalkUpTextCheck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerObject._WalkUpTextCheck(out shouldExit: Boolean): Boolean;

Internal TRSWalkerObject helper method that is used by all walking hover methods.
You probably don't need to use this directly.


------------

TRSWalkerObject._ClickHelper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerObject._ClickHelper(leftClick: Boolean): Boolean;

Internal TRSWalkerObject helper method that is used by other clicking methods.
You probably don't need to use this directly.

This is what's responsible for deciding if we click a target we are hovering or not.


------------

TRSWalkerObject._SelectHelper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalkerObject._SelectHelper(action: TStringArray): Boolean;

Internal TRSWalkerObject helper method that is used by other select methods.
You probably don't need to use this directly.

This is what is responsible for deciding if we just left click a target we are hovering or right click it and choose an option.


------------

type TRSObject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjects are a type of TRSWalkerObject.
This are meant to be TRSWalkerObjects that do not have a minimap dot so TRSObject.Filter.MinimapDot is False by default and shouldn't be changed.


------------

TRSObject.Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  procedure TRSObject.Setup(shape: Vector3; coordinates: TPointArray); overload;
  procedure TRSObject.Setup(size, height: Double; coordinates: TPointArray); overload;
  procedure TRSObject.Setup(height: Double; coordinates: TPointArray); overload;

All this extend the basic `TRSWalkerObject.Setup(coordinates: TPointArray)`.
For TRSObjects this are the methods that should be used for setting them up initially.

In TRSObject.Setup(shape: Vector3; coordinates: TPointArray), **shape** should be a vector3 of the object shape in number of tiles:
- shape.X: number of tiles of the object from west to east.
- shape.Y: number of tiles of the object from north to south.
- shape.Z: object height, this value has to be guessed, I recommend you try several values and debug it until it looks good to you.
           As some examples, player and npcs height is around 7, bank chests 4, yew/magic trees 14/16.

In TRSObject.Setup(size, height: Double; coordinates: TPointArray), **size** and **height** are used
to create a Vector3 "shape" and call TRSObject.Setup(shape: Vector3; coordinates: TPointArray).
In this case, **shape.X** and **shape.Y** would be both equal to **size**.

Lastly, TRSObject.Setup(height: Double; coordinates: TPointArray) also calls TRSObject.Setup(shape: Vector3; coordinates: TPointArray)
and sets the **shape.X** and **shape.Y** to 1.


------------

TRSObject.Find
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  function TRSObject.Find(out floorTiles, roofTiles: TRectArray; out cuboidArray: TCuboidArray; out atpa: T2DPointArray): Boolean;
  function TRSObject.Find(out atpa: T2DPointArray): Boolean; overload;
  function TRSObject.Find(): Boolean; overload;

TRSObject methods used to find a TRSObject. If found returns true, if not returns false.
The first one is mostly meant for debugging and you should avoid calling it instead of the last 2 because it's slower due to gathering more data for the user.
This is what is used in `Debug(TRSObject)`.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn RSObjects.GEBank.Find(atpa); //Be in ge and with a walker setup there.
  Debug(atpa);


------------

TRSObject.Draw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------

TRSObject.AsyncHover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSObject.AsyncHover(): Boolean;

  //Be in varrock with a varrock map loaded.
  rsw.WebWalk(WaspWeb.LOCATION_VARROCK);

  RSObjects.GEBank.WalkHover(2, true); //keep in mind that walking is not async.
  repeat
    WriteLn 'This will print while the mouse is moving because it's asynchronously!';
  until MainScreen.IsUpText('Exch');

  rsw.WebWalk(WaspWeb.LOCATION_VARROCK);

------------

type TRSMMDot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSMMDot are a type of TRSWalkerObject.
This are meant to be TRSWalkerObjects that have a minimap dot so TRSMMDot.Filter.MinimapDot is True by default and shouldn't be changed.
This also have a **DotType** variable for the type of ERSMinimapDot they have (PLAYER, NPC, ITEM) and a **DotFilter** which is used to
filter mmdots in/out of circles and/or polygons so we only focus on the TRSMMDots we want.


------------

TRSMMDot.Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal


  procedure TRSMMDot.Setup(radius: Int32; shape: Vector3; coordinates: TPointArray); overload;
  procedure TRSMMDot.Setup(radius: Int32; size, height: Double; coordinates: TPointArray); overload;
  procedure TRSMMDot.Setup(radius: Int32; height: Double; coordinates: TPointArray); overload;

All this extend the basic `TRSWalkerObject.Setup(coordinates: TPointArray)` specifically for TRSMMDots.
For TRSMMDots this are the methods that should be used for setting them up initially.

In TRSMMDot.Setup(radius: Int32; shape: Vector3; coordinates: TPointArray),
**radius** is used to create a simple TRSDotFilterArray of that radius with **cordinates** and their center point.
**shape** should be a vector3 of the target shape in number of tiles:

- shape.X: Number of tiles of the target from west to east.

- shape.Y: Number of tiles of the target from north to south.

- shape.Z: Target height, this value has to be guessed, I recommend you try several values and debug it until it looks good to you. As some examples, player and npcs height is around 7, bank chests 4, yew/magic trees 14/16.


For NPCs that can move and are 1x2 tiles or any uneven number of tiles,
I recommend you just set **shape.X** and **shape.Y** to the largest one. So a cow I would recommend making the shape 2x2.


The other methods all call this first one with certain default values:

- Size makes shape.X and shape.Y equal to size.

- If size is omited, shape.X and shape.Y are set to 1.
