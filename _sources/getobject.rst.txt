  of and click with the mouse middle button.
  You can record several tiles at once into an array by click several tiles in
  a row.
  The Tile or TileArray will be printed everytime you add a tile.

  To reset the array press space bar for a couple of seconds, maybe even
  a couple of times because Simba is bad at registering user key presses.

  Once the message "Array cleared." shows up you can start again.
